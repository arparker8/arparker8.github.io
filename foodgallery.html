      <h1>Photos of Ingredients and Desserts</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">All these photos are from another final project I had in a photography class I took in college. I was just getting into a new hobby of mine, baking. I was also trying to come up with new things to photograph with my micro lens. So, I decided to take photos of the main ingredient in the dessert and then take a photo of the finished dessert. I had to print out the photos and put them in a professional binder. My layout for the book is the same as the website, them being right next to each other so you can see they went together.</p>
