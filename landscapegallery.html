         <h1>My Favorite Landscape Photos</h1>
         <p class="paragraph">The photos in this gallery contain some of my favorite landscape photos that I have taken
            over the last 6 years. Landscape or nature photos are my favorite photos to take. I have probably a thousand
            different ones but when going through my photos these were the ones that stood out to me the most.</p>

               <img src="photos/landscape-gallery/landscape1.jpg" width="700" height="400"
                  alt="Landscape photo of a cloudy sky.">
               <p>"Stormy Sky" - June 15th, 2023</p>
               <p class="paragraph1">This photo I took on a whim when there was a storm heading toward my house. Once I
               took the photo, I loved the contrast in colors. From the rich green to the dark blue in the distance from
               the storm. The photo wasn’t flat and told a story. The contrast also helped make the formation of the
               clouds visible.</p>

                  alt="Landscape photo of a sunset.">
               <p>"Beautiful Sunset" - December 25th, 2022</p>
               <p class="paragraph1">Sunsets are my favorite time of day; I have probably hundreds of photos of them.
               It was hard to pick just one but this one stood out to me. I loved the cloud formation as well as the
               colors that are being highlighted in the sky. </p>

         <p class="paragraph">These two photos are ones I took when I took a day trip up to Colorado Springs to go see
            the Garden of the Gods. It was a beautiful sunny day but there were some clouds, which is how I got the
            photo on the left. I have found that contrast in color can really make a photo more dynamic and outdoors
            photos have so many different rich colors.</p>

         <p class="paragraph">I am very happy with these lightning photos they are one of my favorites of all time. The
            reasoning is because getting lightning photos is super hard, I found out. It’s all about timing and I feel
            like it’s lucky because you never know when or where it’s going to strike. So, you hope that you click at
            the right time and that the subject is in focus. It was a lot of fun though testing and trying again, I
            learn a lot about my camera taking these photos.</p>

                  alt="Landscape photo of the night sky with clouds and the moon.">

         <p class="paragraph">These last two photos are my attempts at night photography. I love looking at the night
            sky and where I live you can see the stars very clearly because we don’t live near a city or town. I wanted
            to try and capture the moon and stars with my camera. You must have your camera on a tripod and the shutter
            needs to be open for a longer amount of time because of how little lighting there is at night. I enjoyed
            taking these photos and will definitely be taking more night photos in the future.</p>
